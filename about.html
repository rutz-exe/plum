      <p>This project tackles Plum's challenge of engaging first-time founders by breaking it down into two distinct, sequential parts. First, we make them interested. Then, we make them choose Plum.</p>
      
      <h2>Part 1: The Awareness campaign</h2>
      <p>The initial and largest hurdle is getting insurance on a founder's radar. They are focused on product, growth, and fundraising, not really benefits.</p>
      <p>Instead of talking about insurance, we talk about what they care about: hiring top talent, reducing churn, and de-risking their business. This part of the project details the channels, content, and creative strategy designed to make founders seek out a solution and get familiar with insurance.</p>
      
      <h2>Part 2: The conversion landing page</h2>
      <p>Once a founder is interested, we need to provide a clear, compelling reason to choose Plum over traditional brokers or other alternatives. This requires a different approach.</p>
      <p>This second part focuses on crafting the perfect landing page content. It's designed to resonate with a startup's unique needs, highlighting not just the insurance itself, but the seamless experience, time-saving administration, and critical Value-Added Services (VAS) that make Plum the perfect choice for Startups.</p>
